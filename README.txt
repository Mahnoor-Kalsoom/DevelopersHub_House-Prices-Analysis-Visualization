# House Prices Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a house prices dataset to understand key factors affecting house prices. It includes data cleaning, visualization, correlation analysis, and preparation for predictive modeling.

### Key Objectives:
- Explore dataset structure, data types, and missing values.
- Visualize distributions and relationships between features and SalePrice.
- Identify correlations between numeric features.
- Prepare insights for predictive modeling (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting).

## Features

- **Dataset Inspection:** View dataset shape, columns, and data types.  
- **Missing Values Analysis:** Visualize missing data using heatmaps.  
- **Distribution Analysis:** Histogram of SalePrice with KDE.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmap of numeric feature correlations.  
- **Feature Relationships:**  
  - Scatterplots (e.g., GrLivArea vs SalePrice)  
  - Boxplots (e.g., OverallQual vs SalePrice)  
  - Countplots for categorical features (e.g., HouseStyle)  

## Dataset
